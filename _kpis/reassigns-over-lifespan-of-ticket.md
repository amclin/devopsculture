Lack of ownership of tickets is a serious issue in projects. Most times we see tickets assigned and reassigned without additional information teams can learn from

# Formula
The total number of assignees can be determined through simple addition:
* N<sub>a</sub>: Number of assignees over lifespan of ticket
* N<sub>b</sub>: Number of updates to description on a ticket
* N<sub>c</sub>: Number of distinct assignees on a ticket

## Maturity Score
b / c = 1  shows the maturity of the team providing valuable information exchange
