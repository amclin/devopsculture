* N<sub>a</sub>: Number of recommended solutions / approaches

## Maturity Score
This is not a direct metric from the JIRA ticket process, a custom metric need to be defined and tracked for this purpose. It does not mean that there should be n number of PoCs before implementing a solution, yet, the number of innovative solution will be the gauge and will have to be defined by the tech leads this is a subjective metric
